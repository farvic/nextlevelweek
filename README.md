# Introduction

Proffy connects the student with a professor who is offering his services.

* The student is able to filter the proffy using the subject, day and time.
* The proffy can offer his services by creating a profile with his name, avatar, whatsapp, a bio and classes.

This app was developed during the Next Level Week from Rocketseat.

# Getting Started

It uses Node.js, Express.js to comunicate with a SQLite database. Before executing the project, node modules need to be installed.

In order to install Node.js and Express.js on your machine, I suggest you to check the link below:

Node and Express.js: [Installing Node.js and Express.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment)

After installing Node.js, use the following command to install Nunjucks and SQLite:

Installing Nunjucks: 'npm install nunjucks'

Installing Sqlite-async: 'npm install sqlite-async'

# Next steps

* Add an authentication to allow a proffy to manage his/her classes.
